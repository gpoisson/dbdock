#  			NOTE:  This directory may contain either PDBQT or PDB files, representing input ligands. If PDBQT files are supplied,
#         		they will be converted to (not replaced with) PDB files. This is because RDKit is able to quickly convert a PDB
#         		to a "mol" object, from which features may be computed.

# 		Receptor PDBQT file:

protein_path = ./receptor/



# 		Rigid docking output directory:

#		Flexible docking output directory:

# 		Program directory for autodock:

# 		Initial noise to add to data when initially loaded (helps prevent overfitting):
