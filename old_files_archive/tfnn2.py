Your dataset.

Initial guesses, which will be refined by TensorFlow.

m_initial = -0.5 # Initial guesses
b_initial =  1.0

'''
Define free variables to be solved.
'''
m = tf.Variable(m_initial) # Parameters
b = tf.Variable(b_initial)

'''
Define the error between the data and the model as a tensor (distributed computing).
'''
ys_model = m*xs+b # Tensorflow knows this is a vector operation
total_error = tf.reduce_sum((ys-ys_model)**2) # Sum up every item in the vector

'''
Once cost function is defined, create gradient descent optimizer.
'''
optimizer_operation = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate=0.001).minimize(total_error) # Does one step

Something you just have to do.

All calculations are done in a session.

with tf.Session() as session:

    for iteration in range(_EPOCHS):
        session.run(optimizer_operation)
